  about: `I'm a senior frontend developer, a team leader and a tech advisor in my own field.

I've started as a _flash developer_, extended to _Javascript since IE7_. I'm UX oriented and like to keep technology as minimalistic as possible. Over the years I've also worked with many server-side languages and learnt to grow from them. For me, diversity brings richness.

At work, _my first motivation is dealing with the impossible_. Technical challenges, innovation, unbelievable concepts from paper to production. I aim at those projects with care, and always try to _think out of the box_ in order to make them alive.

**I'm always looking for the unknown thing that will keep me awake late at night, for the need to master it. That's what taught me so much so far, that's what will keep me up to date in 10 years.**`,
